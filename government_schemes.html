 Ministry of Science & Technology , Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) 
 Key Sector Covered: Biotechnology 
 
 EligibilityCriteria: BIPP covers four broadcategories(I,II,III&IV) as described below: 
 Category I: Areas with major social relevance but uncertain market driven demand Category II: High risk, discovery and innovation research with relevance for makingIndiaglobally competitive Category III A: Evaluation & validation of already existing products of high nationalimportancepromoting local innovation(Clinical Trials) Category III B:Evaluation & validation of already existing products of high nationalimportancepromoting localinnovation (AgricultureField Trials) CategoryIV:Shared costmajorfacilities,criticalforenablinginnovation
 Brief:
 The main aim of the scheme is to provide support for high risk , accelerated technology development especially in futuristic technologies. Support for very high risk, nationally and socially relevant areas, with no assured market. This would be more of translational research in such cases. It is envisaged that public institutes would be useful partners, so that the basic R&D leads can be translated to product development by the industry. 
 Provides for product evaluation and validation through support for limited and large- scale field trial for agriculture products and clinical trials (Phase I, II, III) for health care products. Supporting research project for novel IP generation.
